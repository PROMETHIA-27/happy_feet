`slither` privides tools for implementing character movement in the [bevy] game engine, using [avian3d] for physics.
The main function is `move_and_slide` which, you guessed it, moves and slides the character along the world geometry.

```rust
let movment = slither::move_and_slide(position, velocity, ..etc);

position = movement.position;
velocity = movement.velocity;
```

There's also `project_on_floor` which simply projects a vector on a plane, but it does
it in such a way that the resulting vector aligns with the input vector on the horizontal axis
without skewing it down the slope.

It basically allows you to walk up slopes without subtly changing the movement direction, which is anoying.

```rust
let accel = acceleration(velocity, input_direction, ..etc);
velocity += project_on_floor(accel, floor.normal, ..etc);
```

That's it! 

Feel free to check out the [example](examples/minimal.rs) once I've cleaned it up.

### Todo (now):

- [ ] stair stepping
- [ ] platform velocity
- [ ] 2d support
- [ ] improve stability when sliding on complext geometry

### Todo (later):
- [ ] lil platformer demo to test if it works for actual games
- [ ] merge into [avian] inshallah
